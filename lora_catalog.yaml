  # ACCELERATION LoRAs - Reduce generation steps
  # ========================================
  # These LoRAs reduce Wan 2.2 generation from 30+ steps to 4 steps
  # ALWAYS use strength 1.0 for acceleration LoRAs
  # Must match exact model variant (high/low noise, t2v/i2v)

# Boost score guidelines:
#   2.0+ : Critical match, strongly prefer this LoRA
#   1.5  : Good match, prefer this LoRA
#   1.0  : Relevant match, consider this LoRA
